# blockchain_sophomore
blockchain project made by C++
when i was a sophomore - 2025

** Do not use this code for security. The code is not safe.

must know
- C++ basic grammar: <iostream>, cout, cin, endl, int, string, char
- C++ basic function: return, break, if, for, while, switch, void main(){}
- class: private:, public:, constructor(default, parameterized), initialization area 
- class relation: inheritance(class Parent{}, class Child : class Parent{})
- class relation: composition(class Component{}, class Full{ Component a; })

outline
- project name: Protecting Virtual Wallet with BlockChain
- object
  : materialize temporary virtual wallet to make a program that makes DigitalSign and PrivateKey automatically. Here, PrivateKey is a 5-digit number. In order not to be easily estimated, Hash number is used and make it more private and unique.
  : make it able to transfer money with default wallet, which is made from default constructor
** of course, BlockChain itself is hard enough, so my major purpose on making this code is not embody a perfect blockchain. Just have a taste about how blockchain can be made only by learning the basic C++ functions. That is why the code isn't perfect and lack in quality to use for safety.

develop motive
- what is blockchain: currently, we use blockchain to protect virtual wallet and account that store our cryptocurrency. I heard that C++ is nice to materialize the blockchain code by using const, or class' access modifier like private for the safety.
- problem: store the user's money on the temporary virtual wallet made in the program.
